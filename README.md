# My Linux Desktop Journey

I used Linux as my primary Desktop OS between 1999 and 2012, in chronological order on RedHat, [SuSE Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SUSE), [Mandrake Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandriva), Debian and Ubuntu, first on [KDE Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDE), next on [GNOME Desktop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME) since version [0.99.1](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/1998-December/msg00004.html) (interesting blog and podcast: [« The History of GNOME »](https://www.bassi.io/articles/2018/10/25/history-of-gnome-episode-1/)).

July 2012, with the arrival of [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) I switched to MacOS as my primary Desktop OS.

Middle of 2021, I decided to pilot a progressive return to Linux Desktop.

I use [these GitHub issues](https://github.com/stephane-klein/my-linux-desktop-journey/issues) to track my hurdles, my goals and [their solutions](https://github.com/stephane-klein/my-linux-desktop-journey/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
